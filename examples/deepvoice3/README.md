# Deep Voice 3

PaddlePaddle dynamic graph implementation of Deep Voice 3, a convolutional network based text-to-speech generative model. The implementation is based on [Deep Voice 3: Scaling Text-to-Speech with Convolutional Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07654).

We implement Deep Voice 3 using Paddle Fluid with dynamic graph, which is convenient for building flexible network architectures.

## Dataset

We experiment with the LJSpeech dataset. Download and unzip [LJSpeech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/).

```bash
wget https://data.keithito.com/data/speech/LJSpeech-1.1.tar.bz2
tar xjvf LJSpeech-1.1.tar.bz2
```

## Model Architecture

![Deep Voice 3 model architecture](./images/model_architecture.png)

The model consists of an encoder, a decoder and a converter (and a speaker embedding for multispeaker models). The encoder and the decoder together form the seq2seq part of the model, and the converter forms the postnet part.

## Project Structure

```text
├── data.py          data_processing
├── configs/         (example) configuration files
├── sentences.txt    sample sentences
├── synthesis.py     script to synthesize waveform from text
├── train.py         script to train a model
└── utils.py         utility functions
```

## Saving & Loading
`train.py` and `synthesis.py` have 3 arguments in common, `--checkpooint`, `iteration` and `output`.

1. `output` is the directory for saving results.
During training, checkpoints are saved in `checkpoints/` in `output` and tensorboard log is save in `log/` in `output`. Other possible outputs are saved in `states/` in `outuput`.
During synthesizing, audio files and other possible outputs are save in `synthesis/` in `output`.
So after training and synthesizing with the same output directory, the file structure of the output directory looks like this.

```text
├── checkpoints/      # checkpoint directory (including *.pdparams, *.pdopt and a text file `checkpoint` that records the latest checkpoint)
├── states/           # audio files generated at validation and other possible outputs
├── log/              # tensorboard log
└── synthesis/        # synthesized audio files and other possible outputs
```

2. `--checkpoint` and `--iteration` for loading from existing checkpoint. Loading existing checkpoiont follows the following rule:
If `--checkpoint` is provided, the checkpoint specified by `--checkpoint` is loaded.
If `--checkpoint` is not provided, we try to load the model specified by `--iteration` from the checkpoint directory. If `--iteration` is not provided, we try to load the latested checkpoint from checkpoint directory.

## Train

Train the model using train.py, follow the usage displayed by `python train.py --help`.

```text
usage: train.py [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--data DATA] [--device DEVICE]
                [--checkpoint CHECKPOINT | --iteration ITERATION]
                output

Train a Deep Voice 3 model with LJSpeech dataset.

positional arguments:
  output                        path to save results

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG               experimrnt config
  --data DATA                   The path of the LJSpeech dataset.
  --device DEVICE               device to use
  --checkpoint CHECKPOINT       checkpoint to resume from.
  --iteration ITERATION         the iteration of the checkpoint to load from output directory
```

- `--config` is the configuration file to use. The provided `ljspeech.yaml` can be used directly. And you can change some values in the configuration file and train the model with a different config.
- `--data` is the path of the LJSpeech dataset, the extracted folder from the downloaded archive (the folder which contains metadata.txt).
- `--device` is the device (gpu id) to use for training. `-1` means CPU.
- `--checkpoint` is the path of the checkpoint.
- `--iteration` is the iteration of the checkpoint to load from output directory.
See [Saving-&-Loading](#Saving-&-Loading) for details of checkpoint loading.
- `output` is the directory to save results, all results are saved in this directory. The structure of the output directory is shown below.

```text
├── checkpoints      # checkpoint
├── log              # tensorboard log
└── states           # train and evaluation results
    ├── alignments   # attention
    ├── lin_spec     # linear spectrogram
    ├── mel_spec     # mel spectrogram
    └── waveform     # waveform (.wav files)
```

Example script:

```bash
python train.py \
    --config=configs/ljspeech.yaml \
    --data=./LJSpeech-1.1/ \
    --device=0 \
    experiment
```

You can monitor training log via tensorboard, using the script below.

```bash
cd experiment/log
tensorboard --logdir=.
```

## Synthesis
```text
usage: synthesis.py [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--device DEVICE]
                    [--checkpoint CHECKPOINT | --iteration ITERATION]
                    text output

Synthsize waveform with a checkpoint.

positional arguments:
  text                          text file to synthesize
  output                        path to save synthesized audio

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG               experiment config
  --device DEVICE               device to use
  --checkpoint CHECKPOINT       checkpoint to resume from
  --iteration ITERATION         the iteration of the checkpoint to load from output directory
```

- `--config` is the configuration file to use. You should use the same configuration with which you train you model.
- `--device` is the device (gpu id) to use for training. `-1` means CPU.

- `--checkpoint` is the path of the checkpoint.
- `--iteration` is the iteration of the checkpoint to load from output directory.
See [Saving-&-Loading](#Saving-&-Loading) for details of checkpoint loading.

- `text`is the text file to synthesize.
- `output` is the directory to save results. The generated audio files (`*.wav`) and attention plots (*.png) for are save in `synthesis/` in ouput directory.

Example script:

```bash
python synthesis.py \
    --config=configs/ljspeech.yaml \
    --device=0 \
    --checkpoint="experiment/checkpoints/model_step_005000000" \
    sentences.txt experiment
```

or

```bash
python synthesis.py \
    --config=configs/ljspeech.yaml \
    --device=0 \
    --iteration=005000000 \
    sentences.txt experiment
```
