# Fastspeech
Paddle fluid implementation of Fastspeech, a feed-forward network based on Transformer. The implementation is based on [FastSpeech: Fast, Robust and Controllable Text to Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09263).

We implement Fastspeech model in paddle fluid with dynamic graph, which is convenient for flexible network architectures.
